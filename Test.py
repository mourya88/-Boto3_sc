# As part of the NRP migration activities, I’ve completed the due diligence for the BLZ account.

Summary of actions performed:
	•	Reviewed the NRP migration prerequisites and impact for BLZ connectivity.
	•	Upgraded the ec2-spoke product to the latest version as required.
	•	Validated security group usage and checked for any dependencies on existing NRP IP ranges.
	•	Ran the recommended query to identify security groups using legacy NRP IP ranges — no results were returned.
	•	Confirmed there are no custom security groups or firewall rules requiring updates for this account.

Based on the above checks, there are no further actions required for the BLZ account at this stage, and it is compliant with the migration prerequisites.

Please let me know if you’d like me to document this in Confluence or provide any additional evidence/screenshots.
