	•	Look for reports named something like:
	•	RAID Log Report
	•	Risk Register
	•	Issue Log
	•	Dependency Tracker
	•	RAID Summary
	3.	Open the appropriate report.

If you’re creating or logging a new RAID entry:
	•	Use “CREATE” from the top menu → Select “Risk”, “Issue”, etc., and the tool will auto-generate a RAID ID once saved.
