I hope you are doing well.

Since the AS3 go-live last year, I’ve had the chance to contribute in several areas—setting up ECS end-to-end with ALB/NLB/API Gateway/Route53/CSM certs, building account-level pipelines, enabling IFE–BLZ connectivity, supporting FAT-to-THIN PoC on ECS/EKS, and more recently working on TYK with EKS.

I always try to give my 100% and take on new tech stacks when required. I’d really value your feedback on my contributions so far, as it will help me improve further and align better with project goals.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
